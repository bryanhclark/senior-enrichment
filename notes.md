## ideas
make an array of imageUrl for the campuses default value, and then set the default value to be a random index in the array
--(might have to do a setter)
-- look at how we did the stackchack newUsers
--make seed file
--make stateful containers that render dumb components
-- Ex: Stateful Campuses that pass down campuses to CampusList as a prop
-- look at juke
#Todo List:
    - make single user view
    - make delete campus router
        - look into validating that all users have been switched off of campus
    - storeStore prop for current input value to handle form validation
    - make put request
    - make delete request
    - use a dialog to display form
        - use snackbar as confirmation that you created a new campus/student
    - make put request
