## ideas
make an array of imageUrl for the campuses default value, and then set the default value to be a random index in the array

-- look at how we did the stackchack newUsers
--make seed file
--make stateful containers that render dumb components
-- Ex: Stateful Campuses that pass down campuses to CampusList as a prop
-- look at juke
